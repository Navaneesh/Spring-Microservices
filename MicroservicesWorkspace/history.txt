ostics information and suggestions below.

Most common reasons for this are:

 * Target node is unreachable (e.g. due to hostname resolution, TCP connection o
r firewall issues)
 * CLI tool fails to authenticate with the server (e.g. due to CLI tool's Erlang
 cookie not matching that of the server)
 * Target node is not running

In addition to the diagnostics info below:

 * See the CLI, clustering and networking guides on http://rabbitmq.com/document
ation.html to learn more
 * Consult server logs on node rabbit@vani-PC

  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' uses port 25672 for inter-node and CLI tool traff
ic
  * TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed

  * Authentication failed (rejected by the remote node), please check the Erlang
